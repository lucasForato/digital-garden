## Welcome to your journey inside my brain  ðŸ§ 

Most of my professional life was not dedicated to the **craft of programming**. I actually started things off as an **English teacher**, I taught English for pretty much 5 years. Teaching prepared me for countless things that coding never did, such as dealing with people of different ages, explain a problem in simple terms, or even effective communication in a non-native language.

Teaching has always been with me. After some time teaching, I understood that it was an effective way of learning, as strange as it may sound. Explaining something through words has always helped me understand them better, even if it was super hard. And it actually has helped many other people as well, just look online and you will find many other people using the same trick.

This blog is my way of expressing my thoughts and what I have been learning, as well as a way for me to keep motivation up even when things don't seem as fun. I guess we all need some motivation from time to time.

I don't intent this blog to be well written or anything, I want it to actually be a collection of my thoughts, when you read it, you are going to be entering my brain, probably you will find it strange, but that is the idea behind this experiment.

Have fun exploring my source code, I think you should start here:
