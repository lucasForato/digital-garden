## Why am I sharing this?

I am passionate about learning and try to do so every day. I achieve this by reading, solving challenges, and creating projects that I enjoy. In fact, my desire to learn **led me to create this blog**. I share my thoughts here because it makes my goals official and motivates me to continue pursuing them.

I chose the topics below because mastering the basics is the best way to become a better software engineer, and every topic below is part of that objective.

## C++
Status: *doing*
C++ is one of my focuses this year. There are many reasons I want to learn it, but the primary goals are:

- Understanding how low-level languages work;
- Having a good old challenge;
- Game development;

I am trying to find a way to learn things better, I tried to read and do some exercises, but that did not have a good effect. Now, I will try a different approach, which is making projects. By doing projects, I will need tools from the language that will lead me to search and learn more about the language, everything while I do something fun. Some projects include:

- [x] 1. An API in C++ for authentication using a database.
- [ ] 2. A game of checkers using C++.
- [ ] 3. A docker container for a C++ project using CMake.
- [ ] 4. A simple text editor.
- [ ] 5. Create the most famous data structures in C++.

You can check out what my efforts led to by reading the articles below:
1. [[A simple API in C++]]
## LeetCode
Status: *doing*
One of the best ways to improve is by using LeetCode to learn to solve and think about problems from different perspectives. I use it as an excellent exercise for my mind.

I have a list of 100 LeetCode challenges I want to finish by the end of this year. The list is on the link below. You can also use it to check my progress.

## Math
Status: *doing*
Math is important for software engineering when it comes to writing performatic code. I have started learning math through [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/). My goal is finishing the following courses there:
- [ ] [Foundational Math](https://brilliant.org/levels/foundational-math/) 
- [ ] [Advanced Math](https://brilliant.org/levels/advanced-math/)
## Conclusion

These are my plans for 2024. I know they are no big deal for many people. My mantra is that I always try to keep things simple; if I achieve these three goals, my year 2024 will be a success professionally, and that is what matters.
